# Keyboard LED bindings for Linux

Copyright (c) 2016 Chris Harvey

Scripts to bind keyboard keys to commands that light up the backlight.

## Why?

When I got a new backlit keyboard, it was a bit annoying to find that the key bindings that
should light up the keyboard did not work under Linux. These scripts bind the Scroll Lock key
and Pause/Break keys to turn the LEDs on or off.
